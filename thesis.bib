  abstract = {This research investigates the influence of computer simulations (virtual experiments) on one hand and real experiments on the other hand on the conceptual understanding of electrical charging. The investigated sample consists of students in the second year (10th grade) of three gymnasiums in Macedonia. There were two experimental groups and one control group. In one of the experimental groups, called Sim group, the instruction was realized by means of computer simulations. In the other experimental group, called Real group, the instruction was realized by means of real experiments. The difference between pre-test results and post-test results revel that the approaches used in experimental groups give more quality knowledge and skills than the one in the control group. The results in the Real group and Sim group are very similar. There are slight differences caused by the different features of the two approaches. Some differences occur based on the feature difference between real experiments and computer simulations.},

  title     = {Effectiveness of simulations versus traditional approach in teaching physics},
  journal   = {European Journal of Physics},
  abstract  = {Computers and computer simulations are no longer new tools in education. The question is whether computer simulations can partially or even completely replace the traditional approaches. In this paper, we describe the outcome of our research, where computer simulations as teaching tools were a competitor to the traditional approach at local grammar schools. Selected factors that may influence the results were taken into account, such as the topic, the teacher’s role or the worksheet layout and its style of guidance. We arranged several modules of didactic experiments, and those showing different ways of organizing the structure of a module are described here. As our results show, computer simulations provide comparable options and are a fully fledged teaching tool, and not only a complementary one.}

  abstract = {This research investigated the implementation of PhET simulation on students’ understanding and motivation in learning the Solar system. The method used in this research was quasi-experimental with matching pretest-posttest group design. The research conducted in one of private Junior High School located at Padalarang, Indonesia with a number of students (n=42). The sampling technique used was the purposive sampling to determine experimental group with PhET simulation in the learning science and control group without PhET simulation. The quantitative data of this research was obtained through the objective test on the mastery concept Solar system, while the qualitative data was detected through motivation rubric and questionnaire. The result shows that the students who learn the Solar system with PhET simulation have higher both improvement in conceptual understanding and motivation than without PhET simulation as teaching media. According to the analysis result, there is a moderate correlation between conceptual understanding and motivation with the learning Solar system in the use PhET simulation.},

  abstract = {Early research investigated the students understanding of science concepts using physical equipment, such as visiting labs and performing experiments but due to the advancement of new technology, students now can learn complex science concepts through advanced means, such as iPad, smart books and simulations. In Pakistan, interactive computer simulation program is rarely used for teaching at the early ages. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the interactive computer simulation program PhET to teach weight and mass concepts to high school students. Quasi-experimental design was used to study the effect of the interactive computer simulation on students’ physics concepts. Study also explored the student’s engagement with simulation to exercise high order thinking skills. The experimental group was taught with the interactive computer simulation program, and the control group was taught with traditional teaching method. There were five lessons each week, and the program was used for a month. Pre- and post-tests were designed for both experimental and control groups. Independent sample t-tests showed that the difference was significant between the mean scores of the experimental and control groups after the experiment (p{\textless}0.001). The paired sample t-test showed that there was a significant difference in the mean scores of pre- and post-test of the experimental group (p{\textless}0.01). The effect size, 0.97 was also found to determine the magnitude of the difference through Pearson’s correlation coefficient r, and a very large effect was identified. Apart from the quantitative data, interviews with teachers and focus group discussions were held to learn the teachers’ and students’ views. The qualitative data concluded that students showed an interest in using simulation, teachers and students appreciated the simulation program for teaching complex physics concepts. The results provided a case for using Information communication technology to improve students’ physics learning. Information communication technology is intended to reduce the culture of rote memorization among students.},
